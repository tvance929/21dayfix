# 21dayfix
Application to help me track my progress with the 21 Day Fix

Currently contains a lot of junk from the angular phone tutorial.  It also needs unit and end to end testing.

This app will save each day to local storage and allow the user to review and edit the days of food.

***Would like to add an export feature.***
